Together, our Getter Dev team worked together to design and develop a web app for Getter, an on-demand tool and construction supply delivery service operating in Australia. The overarching goal of this project is to scale, grow, and optimize existing business and technological processes to transform Getter into the go-to on-demand trade supplier in Australasia.","featuredImage":{"url":"https://media.graphassets.com/Mt4BMBrTTPO0A0MScNgi"},"finishDate":null,"liveProjectUrl":"https://getter.com.au/","overview":"Getter is an on-demand tool and construction supply delivery service operating in Australia.","pageContent":"![getter-mockup.png](https://media.graphcms.com/Mt4BMBrTTPO0A0MScNgi)\n\n### How Does Getter Work?\n\nGetter's main goal is to increase job site efficiency by eliminating the need for tradies and other workers to make supply runs and instead sourcing and delivering supplies directly to customers. Think of it like UberEats for construction/trade tools and supplies. Getter does this through two services: Shop & Deliver and Delivery Only. \n\n![getter-sd.png](https://media.graphcms.com/75AbhuE7T0iYpsSiTPJE)\n\n#### Shop & Deliver\n\nAs the name suggests, Shop & Deliver functions similarly to a traditional ecommerce service. By accessing Getter's online catalogue consisting of thousands of products, customers can create an order with their needed tools and supplies. Upon order submission, Getter will source and deliver the items--either immediately or at a scheduled time in the future.\n\n![getter-do.png](https://media.graphcms.com/Sh6aAcLpT5miqdUAXSXX)\n\n#### Delivery Only\n\nWith Delivery Only, Getter acts as a courier service for orders completed with a third party, such as a customer's local hardware store. Within this flow, a customer provides an estimation of the vehicle(s) needed, and Getter will pick up the items and deliver them directly to the customer.\n\n### Internal Admin Panel\nThe second phase of this project (which is currently ongoing) is the design and development of an admin panel that is used internally by Getter. Similar to the purpose of the customer-facing web app, the admin panel's aim is to increase efficiency for the Getter team. \n\nTo do this, the admin panel provides a variety of functions: viewing orders, assigning orders to drivers, and contacting customers, as well as useful integrations with HubSpot and Stripe. As development continues, the admin panel will become the \"one-stop shop\" for all administrative actions required by the Getter team.","role":"Web Engineer","slug":"getter","startDate":"2021-04-12","techStack":["TypeScript","Next.js","AWS","GraphQL","Stripe"],"title":"Getter"}},"pageContext":{"id":"Project:ckvzj5kgo0dv10b66wtj08n04:PUBLISHED","slug":"getter","__params":{"slug":"getter"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
