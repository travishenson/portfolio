Side Mine/Pirate's Plunder is the most extensive of the templates I created.","featuredImage":{"url":"https://media.graphassets.com/yKDnN6OzSXq2e0CN5i3U"},"finishDate":"2020-06-19","liveProjectUrl":"https://github.com/travishenson/side-mine-koji","overview":"Pirate's Plunder is a match-three browser game built with Phaser 3, a JavaScript game development framework.","pageContent":"![pirates-plunder-mockup.png](https://media.graphcms.com/yKDnN6OzSXq2e0CN5i3U)\n\nThe goal for this project was to create a template for a match-three style game with customizable assets, including character, blocks, sounds, and fonts. Koji's Visual Customization Controls (VCCs) served as a graphically-abstracted interface that would allow users to create their own game while updating various elements via a traditional user input flowâ€”no coding required!\n\nThe game itself operates like most match-three games: the player must match blocks based on their color to clear them out and earn points. The challenge arises from the amount of shifts (horizontal movement towards the player) the player must survive to advance to the next round. Each colored block is worth a different amount of points, so there is some strategy to be had when clearing out blocks. \n\nFrom a technical perspective, this was one of my most challenging projects as a developer. The Phaser 3 framework is quite extensive and has a pretty steep learning curve from my experience using it. As a solo project, this meant hours of studying documentation and a lot of trial and error, but overall, it was a very rewarding process given the quality of game I was able to create in such a short amount of time.\n\nIt's worth noting that, since the completion of this project, Koji has shifted its focus away from game templates so this project is no longer deployed anywhere. However, the working code is still accessible at the GitHub repo.","role":"Developer","slug":"pirates-plunder","startDate":"2020-05-01","techStack":["JavaScript","Phaser 3 (JS Game Framework)"],"title":"Pirate's Plunder"}},"pageContext":{"id":"Project:ckvyf0l68whbn0a26tvbh67ct:PUBLISHED","slug":"pirates-plunder","__params":{"slug":"pirates-plunder"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
