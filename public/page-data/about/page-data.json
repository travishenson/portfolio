What motivates me is the ongoing challenge of finding elegant, code-based solutions to users’ and businesses’ complex problems.\n\nBeing a web developer allows me to do that on a daily basis. That opportunity to learn and grow is what consistently keeps me interested and drives me to keep up with the ever-changing landscape of the internet and web development.\n\nOutside of that, a few of my main interests are sports, horror movies, video games, and photography.\n"}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
